# Stellar Alerts: Local Setup & Freelancer Quick Start

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to set up Stellar Alerts on your local machine, configure the necessary services, and complete the alert flow as a freelancer. 

## 1. Required Services

To run Stellar Alerts locally, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for PostgreSQL and Redis)
- **Stellar Freighter Wallet** browser extension (for wallet connection)
- **Telegram App** (to receive test alerts)

## 2. Environment Variables

The project uses a monorepo structure. You need to configure environment variables for both the `api` and `web` applications.

### API Environment Variables
Create a file at `apps/api/.env` and populate it with the required keys (you can copy from `apps/api/.env.example`):
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/stellar_alerts?schema=public"
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your-telegram-bot-token" # Get this from @BotFather on Telegram
JWT_SECRET="super-secret-jwt-key"
DID_CHALLENGE_TTL_SECONDS="300"
MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY="generate-a-random-32+character-secret"
MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY_VERSION="1"
MASTER_ENCRYPTION_OLD_KEYS="{}"
```
*(Optional features like Twilio WhatsApp require additional tokens.)*

### Web Environment Variables
Create a file at `apps/web/.env` and populate it with the required keys (you can copy from `apps/web/.env.example`):
```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_IGNORE_INCORRECT_LOCKFILE=1
```

## 3. Starting the App

1. **Start Services:** Boot up the PostgreSQL and Redis containers.
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
2. **Push Database Schema:** Sync the Prisma schema with the database.
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```
3. **Launch Monorepo:** Start the Fastify API, worker, and Next.js frontend.
   ```bash
   npx turbo dev
   ```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the API at `http://localhost:3001`.

## 4. Freelancer Alert Quick Start

Follow this flow to connect your wallet, link Telegram, and verify the alerts pipeline.

### Step A: Wallet Connection
1. Navigate to the web app (`http://localhost:3000`).
2. Follow the onboarding wizard or click "Sign In".
3. Use the **Stellar Freighter Wallet** to authenticate via `did:pkh:stellar`. The app securely verifies your public key signature.

### Step B: Telegram Linking
1. In the dashboard, navigate to the **Settings** or **Onboarding** flow.
2. Select **Telegram** as your notification channel.
3. You will be provided with a link to start a conversation with the bot (e.g., `t.me/YourBotName`).
4. Send the verification code or `/start` to the bot to link your account.

### Step C: Test Alerts
1. Register an Alert Rule (e.g., monitor for any incoming payments to your Freighter wallet on Testnet).
2. Use the provided test script to fund the wallet and simulate an incoming transaction:
   ```bash
   npx tsx --env-file=apps/api/.env apps/api/scripts/seed-and-trigger-payment.ts
   ```
3. The ingestion worker will detect the payment and enqueue a job.
4. You should receive a Telegram notification shortly after!

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Database Errors / "Relation does not exist":** Ensure your Docker container is running and that you've pushed the schema using `npm run db:push`.
- **Wallet Connection Fails:** Ensure the Freighter extension is unlocked and configured to the correct network (Testnet/Mainnet). Check your browser console for `did:pkh:stellar` challenge errors.
- **Alerts Not Delivered:** 
  - Ensure the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is correct.
  - Check the worker terminal output for Redis connection issues or BullMQ errors.
  - Review the Dead-Letter Queue in the dashboard (`/dead-letters`) for terminal delivery failures.
- **Invalid Checksum / Base32 Errors:** The system strictly enforces valid StrKey base32 encoding for all G... public keys. Ensure you are copying the full, correct address.
